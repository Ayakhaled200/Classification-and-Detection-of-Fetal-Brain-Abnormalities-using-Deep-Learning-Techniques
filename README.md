# Classification and Detection of Fetal Brain Abnormalities using Deep Learning Techniques
## Building a Site that is used to predict whether a Fetal Brain is Healthy or might have some abnormality using ML and DL tools

Using computer visions, we applied various preprocessing techniques in cooperation with ML and DL Models on Fetal brain Images.
The aim of the Project is to identify wither the fetal is normal or abnormal and also try to define the abnormality type.

### Phase 1
we tried many ML models like KNN, Design Tree, Na√Øve Bayes and SVM in Phase 1 of the project when the data was really poor-quality resulting accuracy that didn't exceed 78%.

### Phase 2 
we tried a lot of preprocessing tools like segmentation, different filters and augmentation techniques in addition to different Dl models. 
We used model tuning on many different models put settled on pretrained like (Inception3v, Alexnet) and non-pretrained like CNN, and CNNSVM reaching accuracy of 97.6 %. We deployed the model and made a website that does the classification after taking the image, producing the normality/abnormality(type) percentage.
